Procedure for adding TV Show:

Make sure you have installed all the requirements, using

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a new DB, and add the DB name and DB user, to the settings.py

then, setup the migrations using South. This can be done with:

$ python manage.py syncdb

$ python manage.py schemamigration main --initial

$ python manage.py migrate main

Now you have finished setting up South.

Then you need to start the django shell and import the main.tv_shows module. This can be done using,

$ python manage.py shell

>>> from main.tv_shows import dump_tv_shows
>>> dump_tv_shows()

This should populate your DB with the TV Shows.
